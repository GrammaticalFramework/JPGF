* Introduction

Enscript converts text files to PostScript or to other output languages.

This directory contains an additional highlighter (.st) for
Scala programs.

More information about enscript is available from:

   http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/

* Installation

Copy the file "scala.st" to the following location:

   <enscript_instdir>/hl/

Add the following line to "namerules" in the file
<enscript_instdir>/hl/enscript.st:

  /\.scala$/					scala;

Run enscript on the command line.

   > enscript --highlight=scala --output sort.ps $SCALA_HOME/doc/scala-devel/scala/examples/sort.scala
