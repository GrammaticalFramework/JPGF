* Introduction

This directory contains additional configuration files (.xml) for Scala
programs. 

More information about Kate (KDE Advanced Text Editort) is available from:

   http://kate.kde.org/

* Installation

Copy the "scala.xml" file to the following location:

   ~/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax/

or alternatively to the location:

   /usr/share/apps/katepart/syntax/

Restart your KDE applications ("kate", etc.).

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
