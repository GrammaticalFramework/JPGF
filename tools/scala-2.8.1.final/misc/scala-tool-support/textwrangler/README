* Introduction

This directory contains an additional plist file (.plist) for
highligthing Scala programs.

More information about TextWrangler (MacOS only) is available from:

   http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/

* Installation

Copy the file "Scala_Configuration.plist" to the directory

   ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextWrangler/Language\ Modules/

and then start the TextWrangler application.

In the dialog window "TextWrangler Preferences" click on the list
entry "Languages" (on the left) and then on the "Add" button to add
the suffix mapping ".scala" for the langage "Scala".

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala"
automatically turns Scala mode on.
