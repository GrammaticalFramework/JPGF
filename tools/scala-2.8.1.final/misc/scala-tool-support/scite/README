* Introduction

This directory contains an additional property file (.properties) for
Scala programs.

More information about SciTE (Win32/Unix) is available from:

   http://scintilla.sourceforge.net/SciTE.html

* Installation

Copy the file "scala.properties" to the following location:

   /usr/share/scite/        (Unix)
   %PROGRAMFILES%/wscite/   (Win32)

Modify the following 4 entries to the file "SciTEGlobal.properties" present
in the same directory as "scala.properties" you just copied (line numbers in
the left margin are indicative):

     source.files=\
     ...;\
244: *.scala
     [..]
     open.filter=\
     ...\
284: $(filter.scala)\
     ...
     [..]
     menu.language=\
     ...\
433: Scala|scala||\
     ...
     [..]
489: import scala

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
