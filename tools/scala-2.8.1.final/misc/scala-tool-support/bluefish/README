* Introduction

This directory contains an additional highlighting section for
Scala programs.

More information about Bluefish (Unix only) is available from:

   http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/

* Installation

Copy the contents of file "highligthing" to the end of the file
"highligthing" located in the directory ~/.bluefish/.

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala"
automatically turns Scala mode on.

* Thanks
