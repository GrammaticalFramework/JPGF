* Introduction

This directory contains an additional syntax highlighting mode (.xml) for
Scala programs. You will need to add a mode catalog entry after placing the
mode file in an appropriate mode directory.

More information about jEdit is available from:

   http://www.jedit.org/

* Installation

Copy the file "scala.xml" to the following location:

   ~/.jedit/modes/

or alternatively to the location:

   <jedit_instdir>/modes/

Add the following entry to the file "catalog" present in the same directory
as "scala.xml" you just copied.

   <MODE NAME="scala" FILE="scala.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.scala" />

Restart the jEdit text editor.

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
