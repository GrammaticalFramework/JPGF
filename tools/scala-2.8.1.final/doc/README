Scala Software Distributions
----------------------------

- scala-<major>.<minor>.<patch>.tar.bz2     Unix distribution
- scala-<major>.<minor>.<patch>.tar.gz      Unix distribution
- scala-<major>.<minor>.<patch>.zip         Windows distribution

The standard distributions require Java 1.5 or above. If you don't
know which version of Java you have, run the command "java -version".


Scala Tools
-----------

- fsc         Scala offline compiler
- scalac      Scala compiler
- scaladoc    Scala API documentation generator
- scala       Scala interactive interpreter
- scalap      Scala classfile decoder 

Run the command "scalac -help" to display the list of available
compiler options.


Unix Installation
-----------------

Untar the archive. All Scala tools are located in the "bin" directory.
Adding that directory to the PATH variable will make the Scala commands
directly accessible.

You may test the distribution by running the following commands:

$ ./bin/sbaz install scala-devel-docs
$ ./bin/scalac doc/scala-devel-docs/examples/sort.scala
$ ./bin/scala examples.sort
[6,2,8,5,1]
[1,2,5,6,8]
$ ./bin/scala
scala> examples.sort.main(null)
[6,2,8,5,1]
[1,2,5,6,8]
scala>:quit
$


Windows Installation
--------------------

Unzip the archive. All Scala tools are located in the "bin" directory.
Adding that directory to the PATH variable will make the Scala commands
directly accessible.

On Windows 95/98/Me, you must define the environment variable SCALA_HOME
to point to the home directory of the Scala distribution to run any of
these tools. This can be done by adding the following command to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then rebooting your machine.

set SCALA_HOME=<install-directory>\scala-<major>.<minor>.<patch>

On Windows NT/2000/XP, you do not need to define any variable in order
for the Scala commands to run correctly.
